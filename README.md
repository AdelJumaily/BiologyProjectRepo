## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my Science Fair Project! This project explores how different types of light affect the growth of plants. By conducting experiments and analyzing data, I aim to discover how specific colors of light can make plants grow better or worse.

**Research Question:** How do different types of light, such as UV, red, and white, impact the growth of plants when exposed to the same conditions?

## Project Overview

- **Title:** Effects of Different Light Types on Plant Growth
- **Objective:** To investigate how various types of light impact the growth of .
- **Methods:** I conducted experiments where I exposed [Specify Plant Species To Be Decided] to different types of light (e.g., red, blue, green, white) and measured their growth parameters.
